# FakeProfileDetection-Transformers

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Transformer-based model for detecting fake profiles on Instagram, combining **BERT** for text and metadata understanding, **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for visual analysis, and **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** for hyperparameter optimization. The approach is evaluated on a combination of the **Cresci-2017 dataset** and a **custom-labeled Instagram dataset**, addressing both textual and visual content to enhance detection performance.

## Abstract

The increasing presence of fake profiles on Instagram raises significant concerns regarding user security, privacy, and the credibility of online interactions. To address these challenges, this study introduces a Transformer-based detection model integrating BERT and ViT architectures, optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The dataset includes attributes such as posting frequency, engagement metrics, follower-following ratio, bio-section characteristics, account age, linguistic patterns, and visual content from profile and post images. Preprocessing steps such as null value handling, feature scaling, and TF-IDF-based text transformation ensure data consistency and effective representation. BERT captures complex relationships in textual and metadata attributes, while ViT enhances visual feature extraction, with PSO optimizing hyperparameters like learning rate, attention heads, batch size, and image patch size. Experimental results show that the BERT-ViT-PSO model achieves a 96.4% accuracy, outperforming conventional deep learning classifiers with precision (95.9%), recall (97.1%), and F1-score (96.5%), highlighting the effectiveness of Transformer architectures and bio-inspired optimization techniques in strengthening security and authenticity on social media platforms.
